# Bard

## The Problem

I wanted a way to transcribe my thoughts in real-time without leaving my computer or switching apps. Every transcription tool I found was either cloud-heavy, required uploading files after recording, or felt clunky for quick capture.

What I needed was **local-first live transcription** — something that sits quietly on my Mac, ready to go when I am.

## The Process

I built Bard for one specific workflow: **ranting**.

When I have an idea, a frustration, or something I need to work through — I don't want to type. I want to talk. I hit record, say what I'm thinking, and watch the words appear. When I'm done, it's saved. That's it.

No file management. No exports. No friction.

The best thinking happens when you're not thinking about the tool.

## The Product

Bard is a lightweight macOS app powered by [ElevenLabs Scribe](https://elevenlabs.io/scribe). It transcribes your voice in real-time, auto-saves everything to a local library, and stays out of your way.

I built this for myself, but you can use it too.
